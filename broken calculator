There is a broken calculator that has the integer startValue on its display initially. In one operation, you can:

multiply the number on display by 2, or
subtract 1 from the number on display.
Given two integers startValue and target, return the minimum number of operations needed to display target on the calculator.

 

Example 1:

Input: startValue = 2, target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Use double operation and then decrement operation {2 -> 4 -> 3}.
Example 2:

Input: startValue = 5, target = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: Use decrement and then double {5 -> 4 -> 8}.
Example 3:

Input: startValue = 3, target = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: Use double, decrement and double {3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10}.
 

Constraints:

1 <= startValue, target <= 109

    int brokenCalc(int n, int tar) {
        if(tar<=n) return (n-tar);
        if(tar%2) return 1+brokenCalc(n,tar+1);
        return 1+brokenCalc(n,tar/2);
    }
};
